    description= _ "The Behemoths were minotaurs who committed crimes that are so severe (i.e. blasphemy), that not even death would be harsh enough to punish them. The process of turning something into an abomination such as this is so dark and secret that only the Elders, the goddess of the minotaurs, and a few people sneaky enough to witness the process without being caught know about it. It is rumored that the crystals are used in this process.

Nonetheless, the Behemoths have been obviously driven into a state of supreme insanity, therefore only one adept in the magic of the minotaurs, or a person to whom the behemoth has been ordered to obey is able to control them. In addition, due to the modifications caused by the ritual, the Behemoths tend to move more swiftly than the rest of their brethren."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DIVINE_HEALTH_ENHANCED}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_BERSERK}
